# gdprwebsiteproject
Creative piece GDPR and data compliance standards integration into organizations 
These files will be included in the submission for the code to be reviewed, the files can be opened in notepad and
be reviewed from there however personally I think it will be harder to read the code through plain notepad
I recommend either notepad++ or visual studio to view the code. 
Website is hosted on github pages, so it can be accessed with anyone that has a link which can be found here: https://truckerfil.github.io/gdprwebsiteproject/
in the case where the link doesnt work or doesnt redirect the user, the user can open index.html in which the website will be fully functional from the users device

Viewing recommendations:

VS Code(https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free)  
Notepad++(https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
