Creative piece GDPR and data compliance standards integration into organizations 
These files will be included in the submission for the code to be reviewed, the files can be opened in notepad and
be reviewed from there however personally I think it will be harder to read the code through plain notepad
I recommend either notepad++ or visual studio to view the code.

Viewing recommendations:

VS Code(https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free)  
Notepad++(https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

Files for review:
index.html
main.js
quiz.html
results.html
styles.css
readme.txt
